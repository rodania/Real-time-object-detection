# Real-time-object-detection
Detecting and tracking object on real-time using deep learning

The model detects objects on videostream or on webcam and follows them if these objects moved.
Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework with a MobileNet base was used

## Single Shot Detector (SSD):
SSD is a straight forward model, easy to implement and has a considerable good accuracy. to be a balance between Faster R-CNN, and Yolo. 

## MobileNet 
MobileNet is light weight network and easier to be loaded in a computer rather than using ResNet or VGG. Its has 21 different classes. In this project, the network was set to detect persons only and track them while they are moving.
